    Instead of binding to a specific port, ``sock.bind(('', 0))`` is used to bind to 0.

    See Also:
        - The port number chosen can be found using ``sock.getsockname()[1]``
        - Passing it on to the slaves so that they can connect back.
        - ``sock`` is the socket that was created, returned by socket.socket.

    Notes:
        - Well-Known ports: 0 to 1023
        - Registered ports: 1024 to 49151
        - Dynamically available: 49152 to 65535
