## ENV Variables
Environment variables are loaded from a `.env` file and validated using `pydantic`

<details>
<summary><strong>More on Environment variables</strong></summary>

- **ROOT_PASSWORD** - System password to get the system vitals and run other `sudo` commands. Mandatory for `Linux`
- **TITLE** - Title which Jarvis should address the user by. Defaults to `sir`
- **NAME** - Name which Jarvis should address the user by. Defaults to `Vignesh`
- **WAKE_WORDS** - List of wake words to initiate Jarvis' listener. Defaults to `['jarvis']` (Defaults to `['alexa']` in legacy macOS)<br>
:warning: Jarvis has limitations on the wake words as it relies on ML libraries for wake word detection.

- **VOICE_NAME** - Name of the voice supported by the OperatingSystem. Defaults to the author's favorite.
- **VOICE_RATE** - Speed/rate at which the text should be spoken. Defaults to the value from `pyttsx3` module. Typically `200`

    <details>
    <summary><strong><i>To add more voices</i></strong></summary>

    **macOS**:
    >   - System Preferences → Accessibility → Spoken Content → System voice → Manage Voices...

    **Windows**:
    >   - Settings → Time & Language → Speech → Manage voices → Add voices

    </details>

- **SENSITIVITY** - Hot word detection sensitivity. Allowed range: [0-1] Defaults to `0.5`
- **TIMEOUT** - Timeout in seconds until which the listener should wait for speech. Defaults to `3`
- **PHRASE_LIMIT** - Timeout in seconds until which the listener will remain active. Defaults to `None`
- **LIMITED** - Boolean flag to run only the main version of `Jarvis` skipping background processes. Defaults to `False` Enforced based on the number of CPU cores.
- **DEBUG** - Boolean flag to enable debug level for logging. Defaults to `False`
- **RECOGNIZER_SETTINGS** - A JSON object that has with customized speech recognition settings.

    <details>
    <summary><strong><i>Custom settings for speech recognition</i></strong></summary>

    These are customized according to the author's voice pitch.
    Please use [recognizer.py](https://github.com/thevickypedia/Jarvis/blob/master/modules/microphone/recognizer.py) to figure out the suitable values on a trial and error basis.

    > These settings are added (optionally), to avoid the hard coded `PHRASE_LIMIT`
    > <br>
    > Cons in using hard coded `PHRASE_LIMIT`:
    >   - Disables the listener after the set limit even the speaker is actively talking.
    >   - Listener will be active until the set limit even after the speaker has stopped talking.

    Sample settings (formatted as JSON object)
    - `RECOGNIZER_SETTINGS`: `'{"energy_threshold": 1100, "dynamic_energy_threshold": false, "pause_threshold": 2, "phrase_threshold": 0.1, "non_speaking_duration": 2}'`

    **Description**
    - `energy_threshold`: Minimum audio energy to consider for recording. Greater the value, louder the speech should be.
    - `dynamic_energy_threshold`: Change considerable audio energy threshold dynamically.
    - `pause_threshold`: Seconds of non-speaking audio before a phrase is considered complete.
    - `phrase_threshold`: Minimum seconds of speaking audio before it can be considered a phrase - values below this are ignored. This helps to filter out clicks and pops.
    - `non_speaking_duration`: Seconds of non-speaking audio to keep on both sides of the recording.

### Background Tasks
There are two options to run background tasks on Jarvis.

- Jarvis can run internal tasks (offline communicator compatible) at certain intervals using a `background_tasks.yaml` file stored in `fileio` directory.
    <details>
    <summary><strong><i>Setup Instructions</i></strong></summary>

  This is the sample content of `background_tasks.yaml`

    ```yaml
    - seconds: 1_800
      task: turn off all lights  # Runs every 30 minutes
    - seconds: 10_800
      task: remind me to drink water  # Runs every 3 hours ignoring the hours specified
      ignore_hours:
       - 21
       - 22
       - 23
       - 0
       - 1
       - 2
       - 3
       - 4
       - 5
       - 6
    ```
    </details>

- **CRONTAB** - Runs external tasks using cron expressions. Needs to be stored as env var.
    <details>
    <summary><strong><i>Sample value</i></strong></summary>

    ```yaml
    [
      "0 0 * * 1-5/2 find /var/log -delete",
      "0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/"
    ]
    ```
    </details>

### Contacts
Jarvis can send on demand notifications using a ``contacts.yaml`` file stored in ``fileio`` directory. Uses [gmail-connector](https://pypi.org/project/gmail-connector/) for SMS and email notifications.

<details>
<summary><strong><i>Setup Instructions</i></strong></summary>

> Note: Jarvis currently supports sending emails only when the ``contacts.yaml`` file is present, however phone numbers can be used directly.

```yaml
phone:
  Tony: 0123456789
  Thor: 1234567890
email:
  Eddard: ned@gmail.com
  Aegon: egg@yahoo.com
```
</details>

### Smart Devices
A source file `smart_devices.yaml` is used to store smart devices' hostnames.
Jarvis supports `MagicHome` for [lights](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08C7GY43L), `LGWebOS` and `Roku` for TVs.

- TV hostnames should include the brand name [`LG`/`Roku`] to distinguish the modules accordingly.
  - This will be set by default, if yours doesn't include the brand name change it in the TV settings.

- For `Roku` TVs, make sure the `Bandwidth saver` feature is turned off under,
    ```text
    Settings/Network/Bandwidth saver >> Off
    ```

- For first time users on `LGWebOS` TVs, there will be a prompt on the TV to accept the connection request. 
  - Once the connection request is accepted a client key will be generated and logged.
  - Please make sure to store this in `smart_devices.yaml` file to avoid repeated connection prompt.

<details>
<summary><strong><i>Setup Instructions</i></strong></summary>

- TV identifiers should have the word `tv` to distinguish between lights and tv.
- The name used in the keys (for both lights and tv) will be the identifier when an action is requested.
- Lights should be a dictionary of identifier and a list of hostnames.
- TVs should be a nested dictionary of multiple parameters.
- The source file (`smart_devices.yaml`) should be as following:

```yaml
bedroom:
  - 'HOSTNAMES'
hallway:
  - 'HOSTNAMES'
hallway basement:
  - 'HOSTNAMES'
kitchen:
  - 'HOSTNAMES'
living room:
  - 'HOSTNAMES'
party mode:  # Light hostnames that needs to be engaged for party mode, if not present individual lights can be enabled
  - 'HOSTNAMES'
living room tv:
  hostname: 'HOSTNAME'
  client_key: 'CLIENT_KEY'  # Generated automatically if unavailable
  mac_address:  # Mac addresses can either be a string or a list
  - 'WIRED_MAC_ADDRESS'
  - 'WIRELESS_MAC_ADDRESS'
bedroom tv:
  hostname: 'HOSTNAME'
  mac_address: 'MAC_ADDRESS'
```
</details>

### Automation Setup [Optional]
Jarvis can execute [offline compatible](https://github.com/thevickypedia/Jarvis/blob/master/modules/offline/compatibles.py) tasks 
at pre-defined times without any user interaction. Uses an `automation.yaml` file as source which should be stored 
within the directory `fileio`

<details>
<summary><strong><i>Setup Instructions</i></strong></summary>

The YAML file should be a dictionary within a dictionary that looks like the below.

**OPTIONAL:** The key, `day` can be a `list` of days, or a `str` of a specific day or simply a `str` saying `weekday` or
`weekend` when the particular automation should be executed.

> Not having the key `day` will run the automation daily.
> Date format should match exactly as described below.

```yaml
06:00 AM:
  day: weekday  # Runs only between Monday and Friday
  task: set my bedroom lights to 50%
06:30 AM:
  day:  # Runs only on Monday, Wednesday and Friday
  - Monday
  - wednesday
  - FRIDAY
  task: set my bedroom lights to 100%
08:00 AM:  # Runs only on Saturday and Sunday
  day: weekend
  task: set my bedroom lights to 100%
09:00 PM:  # Runs daily
  task: set my bedroom lights to 5%
12:00 AM:  # Even performs tasks that are not supported via voice commands
  task: restart all background processes
```
</details>
