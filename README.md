## Setup

> **Test Peripherals**:
>   - Camera: [camera.py](https://github.com/thevickypedia/Jarvis/blob/master/modules/camera/camera.py)
>   - Speaker: [speak.py](https://github.com/thevickypedia/Jarvis/blob/master/modules/speaker/speak.py)

   - Navigate into the downloaded `jarvis` or `jarvis-master` directory.
   - Run the following commands in a command-line/terminal:
     1. `python3 -m venv venv` - Creates a virtual env named `venv`
     2. `source venv/bin/activate` - Activates the virtual env `venv`
     3. `which python` - Validate which python is being used. Should be the one within the virtual env `venv`
     4. `chmod +x lib/install.sh` - Makes [installation file](https://github.com/thevickypedia/Jarvis/blob/master/lib/install.sh) as executable.
     5. `bash lib/installs.sh` - Installs the required modules based on the operating system.
     6. [`python jarvis.py`](https://git.io/JBnPz) - BOOM, you're all set, go ahead and interact with Jarvis.

## ENV Variables
Environment variables are loaded from a `.env` file and validated using `pydantic`

<details>
<summary><strong>More on Environment variables</strong></summary>

- **ROOT_PASSWORD** - System password to get the system vitals and run other `sudo` commands.
- **TITLE** - Title which Jarvis should address the user by. Defaults to `sir`
- **NAME** - Name which Jarvis should address the user by. Defaults to `Vignesh`
- **WAKE_WORDS** - List of wake words to initiate Jarvis' listener. Defaults to `['jarvis']` (Defaults to `['alexa']` in legacy macOS)<br>
:warning: Jarvis has limitations on the wake words as it relies on ML libraries for wake word detection.

- **VOICE_NAME** - Name of the voice supported by the OperatingSystem. Defaults to the author's favorite.
- **VOICE_RATE** - Speed/rate at which the text should be spoken. Defaults to the value from `pyttsx3` module. Typically `200`

    <details>
    <summary><strong><i>To add more voices</i></strong></summary>

    **macOS**:
    >   - System Preferences → Accessibility → Spoken Content → System voice → Manage Voices...

    **Windows**:
    >   - Settings → Time & Language → Speech → Manage voices → Add voices

    </details>

- **SENSITIVITY** - Hot word detection sensitivity. Allowed range: [0-1] Defaults to `0.5`
- **TIMEOUT** - Timeout in seconds until which the listener should wait for speech. Defaults to `3`
- **PHRASE_LIMIT** - Timeout in seconds until which the listener will remain active. Defaults to `None`
- **RECOGNIZER_SETTINGS** - A JSON object that has with customized speech recognition settings.

    <details>
    <summary><strong><i>Custom settings for speech recognition</i></strong></summary>

    These are customized according to the author's voice pitch.
    Please use [mic.py](https://github.com/thevickypedia/Jarvis/blob/master/modules/microphone/mic.py) to figure out the suitable values in a trial and error method.

    > These settings are added (optionally), to avoid the hard coded `PHRASE_LIMIT`
    > <br>
    > Cons in using hard coded `PHRASE_LIMIT`:
    >   - Disables the listener after the set limit even the speaker is actively talking.
    >   - Listener will be active until the set limit even after the speaker has stopped talking.

    Sample settings (formatted as JSON object)
    - `RECOGNIZER_SETTINGS`: `'{"energy_threshold": 1100, "dynamic_energy_threshold": false, "pause_threshold": 2, "phrase_threshold": 0.1, "non_speaking_duration": 2}'`

    **Description**
    - `energy_threshold`: Minimum audio energy to consider for recording. Greater the value, louder the speech should be.
    - `dynamic_energy_threshold`: Change considerable audio energy threshold dynamically.
    - `pause_threshold`: Seconds of non-speaking audio before a phrase is considered complete.
    - `phrase_threshold`: Minimum seconds of speaking audio before it can be considered a phrase - values below this are ignored. This helps to filter out clicks and pops.
    - `non_speaking_duration`: Seconds of non-speaking audio to keep on both sides of the recording.

    </details>

      "0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/"
    ]
    ```
    </details>

</details>

### Contacts
Jarvis can send on demand notifications using a ``contacts.yaml`` file stored in ``fileio`` directory. Uses [gmail-connector](https://pypi.org/project/gmail-connector/) for SMS and email notifications.

<details>
<summary><strong><i>Setup Instructions</i></strong></summary>

> Note: Jarvis currently supports sending emails only when the ``contacts.yaml`` file is present, however phone numbers can be used directly.

```yaml
phone:
  Tony: 0123456789
  Thor: 1234567890
email:
  Eddard: ned@gmail.com
  Aegon: egg@yahoo.com
```
</details>

### Smart Devices
A source file `smart_devices.yaml` is used to store smart devices' hostnames. `Jarvis` supports [`MagicHome` lights](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08C7GY43L) and `LGWebOS` TVs.

<details>
<summary><strong><i>Setup Instructions</i></strong></summary>

> Note: Jarvis currently supports only one hostname for TV but multiple for lights.

- The name used in the keys will be the identifier of those light bulbs.
- The source file (`smart_devices.yaml`) should be as following:

```yaml
bedroom:
  - 'HOSTNAMES'
hallway:
  - 'HOSTNAMES'
hallway basement:
  - 'HOSTNAMES'
kitchen:
  - 'HOSTNAMES'
living room:
  - 'HOSTNAMES'
party mode:  # Light hostnames that needs to be engaged for party mode, if not present individual lights can be enabled
  - 'HOSTNAMES'
tv: 'LGWEBOSTV'
```
</details>

### Automation Setup [Optional]
Jarvis can execute [offline compatible](https://github.com/thevickypedia/Jarvis/blob/master/modules/offline/compatibles.py) tasks 
at pre-defined times without any user interaction. Uses an `automation.yaml` file as source which should be stored 
within the directory `fileio`

<details>
<summary><strong><i>Setup Instructions</i></strong></summary>

The YAML file should be a dictionary within a dictionary that looks like the below.

**OPTIONAL:** The key, `day` can be a `list` of days, or a `str` of a specific day or simply a `str` saying `weekday` or
`weekend` when the particular automation should be executed.

> Not having the key `day` will run the automation daily.
> Date format should match exactly as described below.

```yaml
06:00 AM:
  day: weekday  # Runs only between Monday and Friday
  task: set my bedroom lights to 50%
06:30 AM:
  day:  # Runs only on Monday, Wednesday and Friday
  - Monday
  - wednesday
  - FRIDAY
  task: set my bedroom lights to 100%
08:00 AM:  # Runs only on Saturday and Sunday
  day: weekend
  task: set my bedroom lights to 100%
09:00 PM:  # Runs daily
  task: set my bedroom lights to 5%
```
</details>
